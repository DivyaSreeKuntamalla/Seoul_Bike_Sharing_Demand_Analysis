# Seoul_Bike_Sharing_Demand_Analysis

Description of the problem:

At present, Rental bicycles have been implemented in numerous urban areas to improve the convenience of transportation. Ensuring timely availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public is crucial as it reduces waiting time. Ultimately, ensuring the city has a reliable and consistent availability of rental bicycles becomes a significant issue. The overarching question of interest in this study on Seoul's bike rental demand is "What are the key factors that impact the utilization of bike-sharing services in Seoul, and how do variations in weather,
seasonal changes, and different times (including holidays) influence rental patterns?"

This investigation aims to figure out the precise circumstances that either promote or discourage the use of bike-sharing, allowing operators to optimise their services to more effectively align with the changing
requirements of the city's occupants.

Data Description:

The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint Temperature, Solar Radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall),and number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

Conclusion:

The in-depth study proved that changes in time, weather, and seasons have a big effect on bike rentals trends in Seoul. Rental rates stayed the same during the week and on the weekends, but they dropped a lot on holidays and days when it rained or snowed. A clear rise in rentals was seen during warmer seasons, showing how strongly changes in the seasons affect bike use. These results show how useful it is to use a range of statistical methods to look into and understand the complex factors that affect bike-sharing systems in cities.

I learned how important it is to use a variety of statistical tools to get correct data on how people move around in cities. This study showed again how important time and place are in affecting bike-sharing use, giving clear evidence to help make operational choices. The regression models were also useful because they showed which factors have a big effect on how often people rent bikes. This gave planners and managers of bike-sharing systems useful information for making decisions. Future research could build on this by adding real-time data analytics to dynamically predict and react to changes in demand for bike-sharing. Adding demographic and behavioural information about users could
help us understand demand trends better, which would allow us to make more targeted marketing and business plans.

I want to look into how changes to urban infrastructure, like adding more bike lanes, affect how people rent things. It might also be interesting to look at how different towns with different climates and urban layouts compare to each other. Using more statistical models could also make it easier to predict changes in demand, which could lead to bike-sharing systems that are stronger and better able to handle the problems of city life.
