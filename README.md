# Seoul_Bike_Sharing_Demand_Analysis

Description of the problem:

At present, Rental bicycles have been implemented in numerous urban areas to improve the convenience of transportation. Ensuring timely availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public is crucial as it reduces waiting time. Ultimately, ensuring the city has a reliable and consistent availability of rental bicycles becomes a significant issue. The overarching question of interest in this study on Seoul's bike rental demand is "What are the key factors that impact the utilization of bike-sharing services in Seoul, and how do variations in weather,
seasonal changes, and different times (including holidays) influence rental patterns?"

This investigation aims to figure out the precise circumstances that either promote or discourage the use of bike-sharing, allowing operators to optimise their services to more effectively align with the changing
requirements of the city's occupants.

Data Description:

The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint Temperature, Solar Radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall),and number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
